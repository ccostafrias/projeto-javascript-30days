    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let kluuse = 5
    let zeroFicia = kluuse
    console.log(kluuse, zeroFicia)

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // const friends = players
    // console.log(players, friends)

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // friends.push('kluuse')
    // console.log(players, friends)

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const newSlice = players.slice()
    console.log(players, newSlice)

    newSlice.push('kluuse')
    console.log(players, newSlice)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const newConcat = [].concat(players)
    console.log(players, newConcat)

    newConcat.push('kluuse')
    console.log(players, newConcat)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // const newSpread = [...players]
    const newSpread = Array.from(players)
    console.log(players, newSpread)

    newSpread.push('kluuse')
    console.log(players, newSpread)
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const objSpread = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))
    // const objSpread = Object.assign({}, person)
    console.log(person, objSpread)

    objSpread.age = 92
    console.log(person, objSpread)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
